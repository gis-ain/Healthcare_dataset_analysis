# **HEALTHCARE DATASET ANALYSIS**

This repository contains my first data analytics portfolio project , focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using MySQL on a synthetic healthcare dataset sourced from Kaggle.
The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to load, clean, and explore healthcare data to extract meaningful insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital admissions, and billing information.

## **DATASET**
   Source: Kaggle – [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset),
   
   Type: Synthetic healthcare data
   
   Format: CSV ( Patiented.csv)

*The dataset includes patient-level information such as age, gender, blood type, medical conditions, admission and discharge dates, insurance providers, hospitals, and billing amounts.*

## **PROJECT OBJECTIVES**
  Practice real-world SQL-based data exploration
  
  Identify and handle data quality issues
  
  Generate descriptive insights using aggregations and filters
  
  Build a strong foundation for future data analytics projects

## **TOOLS&TECHNOLOGIES**
  **MySQL** – *Data loading, cleaning, and EDA*
  
  **Jupyter Notebook** – *Query documentation and analysis walkthrough*
  
  **Excel** – *Initial inspection (reference only)*

## **KEY ANALYSIS AREAS**
  Patient Count: *Establish baseline size of the dataset*
  
  Provider Coverage: *Analyze unique hospitals, doctors, and admission types*
  
  Relational Validation: *Join patient and hospital tables to verify data integrity*
  
  Data Quality Checks: *Identify records needing date or field validation*

**Notes**

*This is a learning-focused project and my first step into data analytics. Feedback, suggestions, and insights are highly welcome as I continue to improve my SQL and analytical skills.*
